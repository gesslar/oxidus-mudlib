  "faintly here, the way a stopped clock keeps the time it died at. A "
  "green opens about a dry stone well -- out of which, oddly, a cold "
  "underground breath keeps rising -- ringed by leaning cottages whose "
  "doorways gape and whose windows are nothing but dark. Grass has come "
  "up through the packed earth where markets stood; a child's hoop, "
  "perished to a brown circle, lies where it was dropped and never "
  "fetched. To the west a cottage stands a little sounder than its "
  "fellows. Eastward a lych-gate and the chapel's wall mark holy ground. "
  "North the green gives way to bramble, a wall of thorn higher than a "
  "rider, from which the crows come and go. The road south climbs back "
  "toward the living world.");

      "clean away into some hollow beneath, and out of that dark a slow "
      "cold breath of earth and old stone comes sighing up. Iron rungs, "
      "rusted but sound, ladder down the shaft into the under-dark. The "
      "windlass has rotted from its frame and the bucket-chain lies "
