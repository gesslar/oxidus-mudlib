  "kept. The flagged floor has been swept; the few plain benches stand in "
  "their rows; and on the stone altar beneath a narrow window a single "
  "candle burns, its flame unwavering in the windless dark. Whoever tends "
  "it has been at their work for years: the brass is dull but polished, "
  "the dead flowers cleared and fresh ones -- thornless, carefully "
  "chosen -- set in their place. Above the altar a worn relief shows a "
  "robed figure holding back a tide of thorn with one bare upraised hand. "
  "Here, and only here in all Thornwick, the bramble does not come; it "
  "stops at the threshold as though it remembers being told to. The "
  "churchyard lies back through the door to the west.");
