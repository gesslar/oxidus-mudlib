  "centre of the room, its surface scarred by generations of shears and "
  "dusted with chalk. Half-finished garments hang from a rail near the "
  "hearth, pinned and patient, while a tall pier glass in a gilded frame "
  "waits to flatter whoever stands before it. The tailor works quietly at a "
  "stool by the window, needle flashing, pausing only to measure a customer "
  "with a practised eye and a length of knotted cord.");
