# Container entrypoint for the Oxidus image.
#
# The image starts as root so it can (1) take ownership of the (possibly
# host-bind-mounted) state for the operator's uid and (2) shuffle symlinks in
# the baked mudlib tree, then it drops privileges via gosu to run the driver
# unprivileged. Concretely:
#
#   1. Symlinks every runtime-mutable mudlib path into the persistent state mount
#      at $OXIDUS_HOME/state, so the baked image stays pristine while game state
#      (players, data, logs, certs, ...) survives container/image upgrades.
#   2. chowns the state to OXIDUS_UID:OXIDUS_GID (default 1000:1000) so a host
#      bind mount is writable by - and editable as - the operator's user.
#   3. Optionally enables TLS telnet using the FluffOS test certs.
#   4. Drops to OXIDUS_UID:OXIDUS_GID and runs the driver in a reboot loop, with
#      proper signal handling for PID 1.
#
# The set of persisted paths is derived from the mudlib .gitignore (everything
# the lib writes at runtime). Add to PERSIST_DIRS / PERSIST_FILES if the lib
# starts writing somewhere new.
